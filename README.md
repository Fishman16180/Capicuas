# PALINDROMIC NUMBER (CAPICUA)
In this project i built a program that solve and answer the following question: How many polindromic numbers there are in a range from a to b?

## What is a palindromic number (capicua)?
A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome or capicua in Catalonia) is a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed. [Here is more info about the palindromic number.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)

## Programs
Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the two programs and what they both do.

Before starting, I must tell you that both programs have been programmed in c++.

Well, the first program called capicua1.cpp, tells you how many palinromic numbers there are from a range of 0 to the number you enter.This program has a problem, and that is that it only works with positive integer values. 

The second program, called capicua2.cpp, tells you how many palindromic numbers there are like the previous one but there is a difference, and that is that the beginning and the end of the range are defined by you (the user). And besides, this program works with negative and positive integer values.
